    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Barilla lasagna recipe is full of layers of delicious ground meat, marinara sauce, and ooey-gooey cheese. It’s the definition of decadence!</p>
    <p>Having three different components, lasagna is not the easiest thing to make. But it only takes one whiff of this Italian masterpiece to know that it’s worth it. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 box Barilla Wavy Lasagne</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage or ground beeg (cooked and drained)</li>
        <li>2 jars Barilla Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>1 15-ox container ricotta chesse</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles in boiling water for 4 minutes and drain with a colander. Run it through cold water to stop from further cooking. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, mix sausage or ground beef and 1 1/12 of the marinara sauce. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix Ricotta, 3 1/2 cups of mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and eggs.</li>
        <li>Grease a lasagna pan or a 9×13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce over the baking dish, about 3/4 cup. Layer 3 to 5 lasagna noodles over the sauce. The noodles should only overlap slightly with each other. Layer the cheese mixture of the noodles, followed by the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers starting from the noodles to the meat sauce twice. Top the meat sauce with the remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
